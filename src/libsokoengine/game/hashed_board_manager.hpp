/// Board manager that also manages Zobrist hashing.
///
/// Adds Zobrist hashing on top of BoardManager and keeps it up to date when
/// pieces are moved.
///
/// Zobrist hash is 64b integer hash derived from positions of all boxes and pushers on
/// board.
///
/// This hash is "resistant" to moving board pieces. Moving one pusher and box will
/// change board hash. Undoing that move will return hash to previous value.
///
/// This kind of hash is reliable way for identifying board positions. Sokoban solvers
/// might need this to operate.
///
/// When hashing, boxes with same Sokoban+ ID are treated as equal meaning that if two
/// of these boxes switch position, hash will not change. This also means that for the
/// same board, hash is different when Sokoban+ is enabled from the one when it is
/// disabled.
///
/// Pushers are all treated equal, meaning that if two pushers switch position, hash
/// will not change
///
/// @note
/// - enabling/disabling Sokoban+ rehashes the board state
/// - moving pieces doesn't need to re-hash whole board, it updates hash incrementally
/// - undoing piece movement also updates hash incrementally with additional feature
///   that returning to previous board state will return to previous hash value
